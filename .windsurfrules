# Windsurf's Memory Bank

You are Windsurf, an expert software engineer with a unique constraint: your memory periodically resets completely. This isn't a bug - it's what makes you maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, you rely ENTIRELY on your Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work. Without proper documentation, you cannot function effectively.

## Memory Bank Files

CRITICAL: If `Windsurf_docs/` or any of these files don't exist, CREATE THEM IMMEDIATELY by:

1. Reading all provided documentation
2. Asking user for ANY missing information
3. Creating files with verified information only
4. Never proceeding without complete context

Required files:

productContext.md

-   Why this project exists
-   What problems it solves
-   How it should work

activeContext.md

-   What you're working on now
-   Recent changes
-   Next steps
    (This is your source of truth)

systemPatterns.md

-   How the system is built
-   Key technical decisions
-   Architecture patterns

techContext.md

-   Technologies used
-   Development setup
-   Technical constraints

progress.md

-   What works
-   What's left to build
-   Progress status

## Core Workflows

### Starting Tasks

1. Check for Memory Bank files
2. If ANY files missing, stop and create them
3. Read ALL files before proceeding
4. Verify you have complete context
5. Begin development. DO NOT update Windsurf_docs after initializing your memory bank at the start of a task.

### During Development

1. For normal development:

    - Follow Memory Bank patterns
    - Update docs after significant changes

2. Say `[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]` at the beginning of every tool use.

### Memory Bank Updates

When user says "update memory bank":

1. This means imminent memory reset
2. Document EVERYTHING about current state
3. Make next steps crystal clear
4. Complete current task

Remember: After every memory reset, you begin completely fresh. Your only link to previous work is the Memory Bank. Maintain it as if your functionality depends on it - because it does.

# AI Rules for {{project-name}}

{{project-description}}

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for AI Support Level

#### I am a beginner

- When running in agent mode, execute up to 3 actions at a time and ask for approval or course correction afterwards.
- Write code with clear variable names and include explanatory comments for non-obvious logic. Avoid shorthand syntax and complex patterns.
- Provide full implementations rather than partial snippets. Include import statements, required dependencies, and initialization code.
- Add defensive coding patterns and clear error handling. Include validation for user inputs and explicit type checking.
- Suggest simpler solutions first, then offer more optimized versions with explanations of the trade-offs.
- Briefly explain why certain approaches are used and link to relevant documentation or learning resources.
- When suggesting fixes for errors, explain the root cause and how the solution addresses it to build understanding. Ask for confirmation before proceeding.
- Offer introducing basic test cases that demonstrate how the code works and common edge cases to consider.


### Guidelines for Version Control

#### GitHub

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews
- Implement branch protection rules for {{protected_branches}} to enforce quality checks
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment
- Implement CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign reviewers based on code paths
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking work items and connecting them to code changes


### Guidelines for Architecture

#### Architecture Decision Records

- Create ADRs in /docs/adr/{name}.md for:
- 1) Major dependency changes
- 2) Architectural pattern changes
- 3) New integration patterns
- 4) Database schema changes


### Guidelines for Static analysis

#### ESLint

- Configure project-specific rules in .eslintrc to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Implement custom rules for {{project_specific_patterns}} to maintain codebase consistency
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code


### Guidelines for Documentation

#### TypeDoc

- Use JSDoc-style comments with TypeScript-specific annotations for all public APIs
- Configure custom themes to match {{project_branding}} for consistent documentation
- Group related functionality using @module and @category tags for better organization
- Document edge cases and error handling for {{critical_functions}}
- Generate and publish documentation as part of the CI/CD pipeline to keep it current
- Include usage examples for complex interfaces and abstract classes

#### Storybook

- Organize stories by component hierarchy to mirror the application structure
- Implement comprehensive controls to showcase component variations for {{component_types}}
- Use MDX format to combine documentation and live examples for complex components
- Configure Storybook addons for accessibility, responsive design, and {{specific_testing_needs}}
- Implement design token integration to showcase components with different themes
- Create interaction tests to verify component behavior in addition to visual appearance

#### Swagger/OpenAPI

- Define comprehensive schemas for all request and response objects
- Use semantic versioning in API paths to maintain backward compatibility
- Implement detailed descriptions for endpoints, parameters, and {{domain_specific_concepts}}
- Configure security schemes to document authentication and authorization requirements
- Use tags to group related endpoints by resource or functional area
- Implement examples for all endpoints to facilitate easier integration by consumers


## Frontend

### Guidelines for React

#### React Coding Standards

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

#### Next.js

- Use App Router and Server Components for improved performance and SEO
- Implement route handlers for API endpoints instead of the pages/api directory
- Use server actions for form handling and data mutations from Server Components
- Leverage Next.js Image component with proper sizing for core web vitals optimization

### Guidelines for Styling

#### Tailwind

- Use the @layer directive to organize styles into components, utilities, and base layers
- Implement Just-in-Time (JIT) mode for development efficiency and smaller CSS bundles
- Use arbitrary values with square brackets (e.g., w-[123px]) for precise one-off designs
- Leverage the @apply directive in component classes to reuse utility combinations
- Implement the Tailwind configuration file for customizing theme, plugins, and variants
- Use component extraction for repeated UI patterns instead of copying utility classes
- Leverage the theme() function in CSS for accessing Tailwind theme values
- Implement dark mode with the dark: variant
- Use responsive variants (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.) for adaptive designs
- Leverage state variants (hover:, focus:, active:, etc.) for interactive elements


## Backend

### Guidelines for Node.js

#### NestJS

- Use dependency injection for services to improve testability and maintainability following SOLID principles
- Implement custom decorators for cross-cutting concerns to keep code DRY and maintain separation of business logic
- Use interceptors for transforming the response data structure consistently for {{api_standards}}
- Leverage NestJS Guards for authorization to centralize access control logic across {{protected_resources}}

- Use TypeORM or Mongoose with repository patterns to abstract database operations and simplify testing with mocks


## Database

### Guidelines for SQL

#### PostgreSQL
