# Product Context: Roadtrip Buddy

## Why This Project Exists
Roadtrip Buddy is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to enhance road trips by providing personalized recommendations for travelers based on their location and route. It aims to help users discover excellent places to eat, interesting attractions, and necessary services along their journey, making road trips more enjoyable and convenient.

## Problems It Solves
- **Discovery Challenge**: Helps travelers find high-quality places to eat, attractions to visit, and services they need while on the road
- **Information Overload**: Curates and filters options based on quality, proximity, and relevance to the user's journey
- **Planning Friction**: Reduces the effort needed to find good stops along a route
- **Local Knowledge Gap**: Provides insider tips and local favorites that travelers might otherwise miss
- **Time Efficiency**: Offers both quick recommendations for urgent needs and detailed information for planned stops

## How It Should Work
The system operates in two primary modes:

### 1. Quick Mode
- For urgent needs (bathrooms, gas stations, quick coffee, etc.)
- Prioritizes speed over depth
- Focuses on proximity and basic functionality
- Minimal analysis of reviews or quality
- Returns results within seconds

### 2. Detailed Mode
- For experience-focused recommendations (good lunch spots, scenic viewpoints, etc.)
- Conducts thorough research across multiple sources
- Analyzes review patterns and quality factors
- Curates images and highlights
- Returns summary results first, then detailed content on demand

### Response Format
All responses are formatted with two distinct sections:
1. A Markdown section for immediate display in the app
2. A JSON section containing structured data for storage and future enhancements

### User Context Awareness
The system takes into account:
- Current location
- Destination (if known)
- Current time
- Previous stops/interests from conversation history
- Selected response mode (quick or detailed)
