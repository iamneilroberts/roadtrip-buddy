# Roadtrip Buddy Development Log

## Project Overview
Roadtrip Buddy is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that enhances road trips by providing personalized recommendations based on location and route. Key features:

- Interactive map with location tracking
- AI-powered chat interface (OpenAI integration)
- Location-based recommendations (Quick/Detailed modes)
- Offline capabilities (PWA)
- Context-aware suggestions (travel direction/history)
- Comprehensive testing (Jest unit tests, Playwright E2E)

Technical Stack:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- TailwindCSS for styling
- React Query for data management
- React Router for navigation
- Jest + Playwright for testing

## Current Status
Development Phase: In Progress (75% complete)
Testing Phase: In Progress (multiple test failures)

Completed Features:
- Core chat interface with OpenAI integration
- Location tracking and simulation
- Direction-aware recommendations
- Context preservation between sessions
- PWA setup and offline capabilities

Pending Features:
- Visual travel direction indicator
- Speed calculation based on location history
- Route prediction algorithms
- Recommendation display improvements
- Performance optimizations

## Roadmap
1. Complete Phase 2 Features (Current Focus)
   - UI enhancements for direction info
   - Speed/route calculations
   - Recommendation improvements

2. Testing and Refinement
   - Fix failing tests (6+ test failures)
   - API integration testing
   - UX improvements

3. Deployment Preparation
   - Performance optimizations
   - Final PWA configuration
   - Production build testing

## Potential Improvements
1. Testing:
   - Address failing E2E tests (chat functionality)
   - Improve test coverage (currently 75%)
   - Add more integration tests

2. Performance:
   - Optimize location history handling
   - Implement lazy loading for map components
   - Cache API responses more effectively

3. UX:
   - Improve loading states
   - Add visual feedback for actions
   - Enhance error handling

4. Features:
   - Implement voice interface
   - Add weather integration
   - Support for waypoints/planned routes
